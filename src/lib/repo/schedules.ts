 * re-submits the ORIGINAL start date, so saving any change to a running schedule
 * rewound it to the loan's first instalment. The nightly sweep then collected one
 * backdated instalment per night until it caught up with today: for a borrower
 * eight months into a weekly loan, roughly thirty further debits of a loan they
 * had already been paying. `today` is a parameter so a caller replaying a
 * historical timeline (the tests) can say which day it is.
 *
 * SECOND, the loan's progress carries across the edit. Every end condition and
 * the double-collection key were keyed on the schedule ROW id, which changes on
 * every save, so an edit reset paymentsMade and collectedMinor to zero and a
 * finished loan would run its whole term again. lineage_id (migration 0010) is
 * the id of the first schedule in the chain and is what those now key on.

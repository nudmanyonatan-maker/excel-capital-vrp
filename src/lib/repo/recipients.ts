 *
 * This updates the NEWEST recipient row for the borrower. When they had exactly
 * one account that was the same thing as "their account". Now they can have
 * several, and the newest is usually the spare rather than the default, so this
 * silently edits the wrong account. It did exactly that on the borrower edit
 * page, overwriting a backup account's real bank details.
 *
 * The one remaining caller is borrower CREATION, where the borrower provably has
 * no recipients yet, so the upsert can only insert.

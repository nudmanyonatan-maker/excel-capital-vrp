/**
 * Finish an authorisation that went out to the borrower's bank and came back.
 *
 * Real banks do not authorise inside our page. Plaid sends the borrower to the
 * bank's own site, and the bank returns them to the redirect_uri we registered,
 * which is this page. Link has to be re-created here with the SAME link token
 * plus receivedRedirectUri before it will report the result.
 *
 * Without this page the borrower authorised successfully at their bank and then
 * landed on "Link invalid or expired", because /setup/complete fell through to
 * the /setup/[token] route with "complete" read as their token. Plaid recorded a
 * success and we recorded nothing.
